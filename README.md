# Card-Jitsu
Card-Jitsu was a multiplayer card game that was available to play on the online game Club Penguin. It allowed players to choose a card representing a type of martial art move (fire, water, or snow) and compete against other players


This code is a small Card-Jitsu inspired game from Club Penguin, in which the player plays against the computer. Each player chooses one of three cards (ice, water and fire) and the cards are compared to determine the winner. The first player to win three rounds is declared the winner. The code uses functions to allow the player to choose a card, to generate a random card for the computer, and to compare the cards. It also uses a loop to play multiple rounds until a player reaches a score of 3.

Card-Jitsu-Easy

The second code is a simpler card game compared to the first one. The rules of the game are simplified because the player and the computer play only until one of them reaches a score of three. The first code is more complex with more detailed rules
